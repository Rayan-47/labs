## Defining the Machine Learning Problem

This is a classification problem.
The dataset contains daily gym attendance and workout-related features such as workout duration, type of exercise, and other activity metrics.

The target variable is whether a member attends the gym on a given day.

The goal of the model is to learn patterns in workout and daily activity data and predict gym attendance based on these features. This can help understand attendance behavior and improve gym engagement strategies.
